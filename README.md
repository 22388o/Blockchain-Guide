# Blockchain Learning Resources

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) is a distributed database meaning that the storage devices used for the database are not all connected to a common processor. It maintains a growing decentralized digital list of ordered records, called blocks. Each block has a timestamp and a link to a previous block. By the system being decentralization it allows for complete transparency in all shared information.

# Blockchain Tools and Frameworks

[Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) is a new Collaborative Project at The Linux Foundation. The technical community is just getting started and will be adding code to the repository in the coming weeks. Check hyperledger.org for more information about joining the mailing lists and participating in the conversations. 

[Hyperledger Fabric](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric) is an enterprise-grade permissioned distributed ledger framework for developing solutions and applications. Its modular and versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry use cases. It offers a unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving privacy. 

[Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) is an implementation of an [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) node in the Go programming language. 

[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/) is a purposefully slimmed down, loosely-typed language with a syntax very similar to ECMAScript (Javascript) that is used for the creation of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. 

[GanacheCLI (NodeJS package)](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is a fast and customizable blockchain emulator. It simulates the Ethereum network on a single computer and allows you to make calls to the blockchain without any of the hassles of running a real Ethereum node.

[Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier. 

[Ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) is a library which was made for and is used by ethers.io. It is designed to make it easier to write client-side JavaScript based wallets, keeping the private key on the ownerâ€™s machine at all times.

[OpenEthereum](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum) is a fast and feature-rich multi-network Ethereum client.

[Quorum](https://www.goquorum.com/) is an Ethereum-based distributed ledger protocol with transaction/contract privacy and new consensus mechanisms.

[Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) is a safe, extensible ORM and Query Builder for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

[BlockShell](https://github.com/daxeel/blockshell) is a minimal command line utility for learning Blockchain technical concepts like chaining & mining. 

[Tendermint Core](https://tendermint.com/) is [Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) middleware that takes a state transition machine written in any programming language and securely replicates it on many machines.

[inDEX](https://distribuyed.github.io/index/) is a comprehensive list of decentralized exchanges (DEX) of cryptocurrencies, tokens, derivatives and futures, and their protocols.

[Squeezer](https://squeezer.io/) is a platform that empowers new-entry blockchain developers to build serverless dApps easily.
